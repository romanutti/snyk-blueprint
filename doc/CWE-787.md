# Out-of-bounds write

A potential [Out-of-bounds write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) issue was found, using [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/).

## Vulnerable code

Our image `openjdk:8u181-jdk-alpine` uses the vulnerable package `bzip2/libbz2@1.0.6-r6`.
The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
The vulnerability exists due to a boundary error within a decompress function in `bzip2`. 
When a specially crafted archive is openend using the affected library, arbitrary code execution on the target system can be triggered using out-of-bounds write.

## Mitigation

Upgrading to a newer base image (e.g. `openjdk:17-ea-22-jdk-oracle`) will fix the issue.
